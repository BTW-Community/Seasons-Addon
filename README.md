# Seasons Addon
Features include:
- Experience the full season cycle of a year - and not just 4 seasons, all 12 Months!
- Seasons are not global. Seen a jungle in the winter before? Nope, seasons are specific to the biomes :eyes:
    - Some have more seasons, others have less. Varying climate distributions throughout the year :wavy_dash:
- Biomes are still intended to keep their identities - everything a season changes still relies on the biome's vanilla values
    - E. g. Taiga will not get too hot, and there will be no snow or rain in the desert!
- Each month looks different, foliage will change color throughout the year
    - Expect the plains to be lush in spring - knowing well that the heat of summer is just around the corner!
    - Autumn-y forests obviously included - if it happens to be fall!
- If a biome gets too hot/dry in a season - no more rain possible. Keep an eye on your crop layout, just as in deserts!
- If it gets too cold though - water will freeze and it might begin to snow. Might need to go ice-fishing after all!
- More in-depth crop system! Certain crops like it more warm, others might prefer a more humid atmosphere :melon:
    - Taiga too cold in the spring? Plains too hot in the summer?  Be sure to exploit different biomes for best yield!
